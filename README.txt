I had a lot of trouble with teams.cpp because I was not sure how to recursively call the function. I tried adding a helper function to swap the lists of the array of lists, but the parameters were const so it doesn't even compile. As expected, the beggining of the assignment, problem 1 & 2, was very easy. Problem 4 gave me some trouble, but it was mainly just reviewing streams and how to read into a vector properly. Additionally the github and submissions took a while to get used to, but i'm more familiar with it now. In my h1 should be a jpeg of my solution to problem 4.
